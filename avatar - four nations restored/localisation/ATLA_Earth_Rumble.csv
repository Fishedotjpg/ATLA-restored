#pillar event
ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_DESC;Mickey brings you into a canyon. "Look out at those pillars. Those are your opponents." There are four pillars in a row, forming a makeshift bridge to the other side of the canyon. "Now, I want you to surround one of those pillars in dust!";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_OPTA_FAIL;The pillar crumbles, but not into dust. It's merely rubble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_OPTB_PASS;As you reach the other side you can't see Mickey. There's too much dust. So with a wave of your hands you settle it. Mickey walks across rocks that he's bending to make a sturdier bridge, slowly clapping. "Now that, kid, was showmanship.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_OPTB_FAIL;As you reach the other side a small blanket of dust covers the makeshift path. You see the shadow of Mickey running across. You quickly realize that wasn't your dust cloud, but his and you duck out of the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_OPTC_PASS;The furthest pillar is covered in a plume of dust. Mickey pats you on the back. "Ya did good, kid. Now we just gotta add a bit more flare to that talent.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

#Fighting Mickey Dust Event

ERB_FIGHT_MICKEY_DUST_DESC;After a rough day of sparing, you head for the showers. Suddenly, a wall of rock forms infront of you. "Not so fast, kid," shouts Mickey. "Before ya can go home you have to fight me." You sigh, you don't want to humiliate the old man. Bending sports are for the youth. But every time you lower the rock wall, Mickey raises it back up. So you hop into the ring. The battle rages on and you realize that Mickey is holding himself against you with ease. If you want to win you'll need to get creative.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FIGHT_MICKEY_DUST_OPTA;You throw a large slab into the air then use a pebble to burst it into dust.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FIGHT_MICKEY_DUST_OPTB;As Mickey lifts a boulder above his head you touch the ground and try to grab the dust particles to shoot into his face.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FIGHT_MICKEY_DUST_OPTC;You wait for Mickey to make his own dust.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FIGHT_MICKEY_DUST_OPTA_PASS;The pebble flies upwards and shatters the slab into rubble and a cloud of dust. You move through the dust and surprise Mickey, throwing him out of the ring. "Using the dust to hide yourself against a stronger opponent, smart." You don't argue that he was stronger. But stronger doesn't mean better. "Good job, kid.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FIGHT_MICKEY_DUST_OPTA_FAIL;The pebble flies upwards and shatters the slab into rubble and a cloud of dust. You try to move through it but you can't control the particles and soon you're lost in your own cloud. A rock launches you out of the ring. As the dust clears Mickey sighs. "Making dust is the easy part. Controlling it is hard.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FIGHT_MICKEY_DUST_OPTB_PASS;The dust swarms in formation, bending to your will. You slide across the ground and launch it right at his eyes. Mickey loses control of the large boulder and you take control, using it to send him flying. "Using the dust to blind me was a smart move. Some call it dirty. I call it dirt-eye.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FIGHT_MICKEY_DUST_OPTB_FAIL;As your hand touches the ground you try feeling the particles like Mickey told you. Slowly they pool around your hand as a boulder flies towards your face. You swiftly dodge it falling out of the ring and getting dust in your own eyes. "You need to work faster, kid," sighs Mickey. You groan as you stand up and head for the shower.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FIGHT_MICKEY_DUST_OPTC_PASS;You run circles around the old man. His shots miss you but they sure do make a lot of dust. Before you know it the whole ring is covered. You were smart. You kept a beat on Mickey, but just to be safe you lift and shake every part of the ring that you're not in. You hear him land outside the ring with a thud. "Good job, letting your opponent do the work. It's best not to use all your energy on one move.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FIGHT_MICKEY_DUST_OPTC_FAIL;You run circles around the old man. His shots miss you but they sure do make a lot of dust. A lot of dust that lands in your eyes. You try to clear the particles, but you find yourself flying out of the ring. "Making dust is the easy part. Controlling it the hard part.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

#Stopping a Skirmish

ERB_WARZONE_DUST_CLOUD_DESC;You wake up to find yourself in the back of a wagon. Mickey's sitting at the reigns. "Rise and shine, kid. We're visiting a war today." You don't know how Mickey got you into this wagon without waking you. But you're honestly too nervous to question it at the thought of war. Slowly you arrive to a large clearing. In the distance you can see two tribes, one small and one really, really small. It's about as much a war as a turtle duck is a badgermole. "Bending sports are what we do when there's no wars. So here's a war." Mickey smiles and says, "Pick a side, help them win.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_WARZONE_DUST_CLOUD_OPTA;Pick the small tribe;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_WARZONE_DUST_CLOUD_OPTB;Pick the really, really small tribe;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_WARZONE_DUST_CLOUD_OPTC;Rush between the two and attempt to create a cloud of dust to confuse them, hoping to end the violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_WARZONE_DUST_CLOUD_OPTA_PASS;You join the tribe of about two dozen warriors. The other tribe is outnumbered, but your clouds of dust confuse them and the tribe has a swift victory. As you triumphantly march away, the commander remarks how useful something like that can be to end a battle quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_WARZONE_DUST_CLOUD_OPTA_FAIL;The tribe defeats their foes, but no thanks to you. They only won because they had twice as many soldiers. Your puffs of dust just got in their eyes delaying what would have been a swift victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_WARZONE_DUST_CLOUD_OPTB_PASS;As you lead the group of a dozen or so warriors into battle you create clouds of dust around their opponents, helping the underdogs take the victory. You understaned. Dust Fighting isn't just about deceitfulness. It gives the small guy a fighting chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_WARZONE_DUST_CLOUD_OPTB_FAIL;Try as you might you're outnumbered two to one. Your pitiful clouds of dust seem to cause more harm than good. The tiny tribe retreats from the skirmish, wounded and covered in dust.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_WARZONE_DUST_CLOUD_OPTC_PASS;You run between the two groups and bellow "STOP!" A cloud of dust swarms up engulfing the area. You hear confused shrieks and quickly pull back the cloud, holding it overhead. "There's no need to fight." The opposing commanders step foward and agree to discuss it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_WARZONE_DUST_CLOUD_OPTC_FAIL;You run out a make a tiny poof of dust above your head as you bellow "Stop!". The tribes stare at you and suddenly burst into laughter. Your dust fighting isn't of much use in battle, but it's good for a quick joke.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

#Locker Room Rubble
ERB_LOCKERROOM_RUBBLE_DESC;You come out of the locker room to find Mickey has blocked the door with rubble. "Mickey! I can't open the door," you shout. "It's rubble, now make it into dust.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_LOCKERROOM_RUBBLE_OPTA;You reach a finger out a crack in the frame and try to smash the tiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

ERB_LOCKERROOM_RUBBLE_OPTA_PASS;Your finger grazes against the rubble and you it turns to dust. You pull the dust against your hand and easily smash the remainder. As you run out you clock another person in the face with your dusty hand, making a rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

ERB_LOCKERROOM_RUBBLE_OPTB_PASS;You shatter the rubble and burst through the door, controlling the dust to hide what you've done.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_LOCKERROOM_RUBBLE_OPTB_FAIL;the rocks crack against the door and you manage to break through. When you exit you see that they aren't dust and you've just scattered them around making a big mess. Mickey hands you a broom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
