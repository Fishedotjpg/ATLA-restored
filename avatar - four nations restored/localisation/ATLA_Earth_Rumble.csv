#pillar event
ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_DESC;Mickey brings you into a canyon. "Look out at those pillars. Those are your opponents." There are four pillars in a row, forming a makeshift bridge to the other side of the canyon. "Now, I want you to surround one of those pillars in dust!";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_OPTA;Stay on the ledge and try to surround the closest pillar;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_OPTB;Jump across the pillars and surround each with dust as you cross;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_OPTC;Stay on the ledge and try surround the furthest pillar.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_OPTA_PASS;A plume of dust surrounds the closest pillar and Mickey nods his head slightly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_OPTA_FAIL;The pillar crumbles, but not into dust. It's merely rubble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_OPTB_PASS;As you reach the other side you can't see Mickey. There's too much dust. So with a wave of your hands you settle it. Mickey walks across rocks that he's bending to make a sturdier bridge, slowly clapping. "Now that, kid, was showmanship.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_OPTB_FAIL;As you reach the other side a small blanket of dust covers the makeshift path. You see the shadow of Mickey running across. You quickly realize that wasn't your dust cloud, but his and you duck out of the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_OPTC_PASS;The furthest pillar is covered in a plume of dust. Mickey pats you on the back. "Ya did good, kid. Now we just gotta add a bit more flare to that talent.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_OPTC_FAIL;The furthest pillar crumbles. Mickey sighs and puts it back up with his bending. "Again." You try again. Over and over the same thing. By the end of the day you go home defeated, not even feeling a comforting layer of earth on your skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

#Fighting Mickey Dust Event

ERB_FIGHT_MICKEY_DUST_DESC;After a rough day of sparing, you head for the showers. Suddenly, a wall of rock forms infront of you. "Not so fast, kid," shouts Mickey. "Before ya can go home you have to fight me." You sigh, you don't want to humiliate the old man. Bending sports are for the youth. But every time you lower the rock wall, Mickey raises it back up. So you hop into the ring. The battle rages on and you realize that Mickey is holding himself against you with ease. If you want to win you'll need to get creative.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FIGHT_MICKEY_DUST_OPTA;You throw a large slab into the air then use a pebble to burst it into dust.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FIGHT_MICKEY_DUST_OPTB;As Mickey lifts a boulder above his head you touch the ground and try to grab the dust particles to shoot into his face.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FIGHT_MICKEY_DUST_OPTC;You wait for Mickey to make his own dust.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FIGHT_MICKEY_DUST_OPTA_PASS;The pebble flies upwards and shatters the slab into rubble and a cloud of dust. You move through the dust and surprise Mickey, throwing him out of the ring. "Using the dust to hide yourself against a stronger opponent, smart." You don't argue that he was stronger. But stronger doesn't mean better. "Good job, kid.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FIGHT_MICKEY_DUST_OPTA_FAIL;The pebble flies upwards and shatters the slab into rubble and a cloud of dust. You try to move through it but you can't control the particles and soon you're lost in your own cloud. A rock launches you out of the ring. As the dust clears Mickey sighs. "Making dust is the easy part. Controlling it is hard.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FIGHT_MICKEY_DUST_OPTB_PASS;The dust swarms in formation, bending to your will. You slide across the ground and launch it right at his eyes. Mickey loses control of the large boulder and you take control, using it to send him flying. "Using the dust to blind me was a smart move. Some call it dirty. I call it dirt-eye.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FIGHT_MICKEY_DUST_OPTB_FAIL;As your hand touches the ground you try feeling the particles like Mickey told you. Slowly they pool around your hand as a boulder flies towards your face. You swiftly dodge it falling out of the ring and getting dust in your own eyes. "You need to work faster, kid," sighs Mickey. You groan as you stand up and head for the shower.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FIGHT_MICKEY_DUST_OPTC_PASS;You run circles around the old man. His shots miss you but they sure do make a lot of dust. Before you know it the whole ring is covered. You were smart. You kept a beat on Mickey, but just to be safe you lift and shake every part of the ring that you're not in. You hear him land outside the ring with a thud. "Good job, letting your opponent do the work. It's best not to use all your energy on one move.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FIGHT_MICKEY_DUST_OPTC_FAIL;You run circles around the old man. His shots miss you but they sure do make a lot of dust. A lot of dust that lands in your eyes. You try to clear the particles, but you find yourself flying out of the ring. "Making dust is the easy part. Controlling it the hard part.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

#Stopping a Skirmish

ERB_WARZONE_DUST_CLOUD_DESC;You wake up to find yourself in the back of a wagon. Mickey's sitting at the reigns. "Rise and shine, kid. We're visiting a war today." You don't know how Mickey got you into this wagon without waking you. But you're honestly too nervous to question it at the thought of war. Slowly you arrive to a large clearing. In the distance you can see two tribes, one small and one really, really small. It's about as much a war as a turtle duck is a badgermole. "Bending sports are what we do when there's no wars. So here's a war." Mickey smiles and says, "Pick a side, help them win.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_WARZONE_DUST_CLOUD_OPTA;Pick the small tribe;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_WARZONE_DUST_CLOUD_OPTB;Pick the really, really small tribe;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_WARZONE_DUST_CLOUD_OPTC;Rush between the two and attempt to create a cloud of dust to confuse them, hoping to end the violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_WARZONE_DUST_CLOUD_OPTA_PASS;You join the tribe of about two dozen warriors. The other tribe is outnumbered, but your clouds of dust confuse them and the tribe has a swift victory. As you triumphantly march away, the commander remarks how useful something like that can be to end a battle quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_WARZONE_DUST_CLOUD_OPTA_FAIL;The tribe defeats their foes, but no thanks to you. They only won because they had twice as many soldiers. Your puffs of dust just got in their eyes delaying what would have been a swift victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_WARZONE_DUST_CLOUD_OPTB_PASS;As you lead the group of a dozen or so warriors into battle you create clouds of dust around their opponents, helping the underdogs take the victory. You understaned. Dust Fighting isn't just about deceitfulness. It gives the small guy a fighting chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_WARZONE_DUST_CLOUD_OPTB_FAIL;Try as you might you're outnumbered two to one. Your pitiful clouds of dust seem to cause more harm than good. The tiny tribe retreats from the skirmish, wounded and covered in dust.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_WARZONE_DUST_CLOUD_OPTC_PASS;You run between the two groups and bellow "STOP!" A cloud of dust swarms up engulfing the area. You hear confused shrieks and quickly pull back the cloud, holding it overhead. "There's no need to fight." The opposing commanders step foward and agree to discuss it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_WARZONE_DUST_CLOUD_OPTC_FAIL;You run out a make a tiny poof of dust above your head as you bellow "Stop!". The tribes stare at you and suddenly burst into laughter. Your dust fighting isn't of much use in battle, but it's good for a quick joke.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

#Locker Room Rubble
ERB_LOCKERROOM_RUBBLE_DESC;You come out of the locker room to find Mickey has blocked the door with rubble. "Mickey! I can't open the door," you shout. "It's rubble, now make it into dust.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_LOCKERROOM_RUBBLE_OPTA;You reach a finger out a crack in the frame and try to smash the tiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_LOCKERROOM_RUBBLE_OPTB;You stand your ground and try to bend the rubble into dust.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_LOCKERROOM_RUBBLE_OPTA_PASS;Your finger grazes against the rubble and you it turns to dust. You pull the dust against your hand and easily smash the remainder. As you run out you clock another person in the face with your dusty hand, making a rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_LOCKERROOM_RUBBLE_OPTA_FAIL;You bend the rubble out of the way, but don't manage to turn it to dust.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_LOCKERROOM_RUBBLE_OPTB_PASS;You shatter the rubble and burst through the door, controlling the dust to hide what you've done.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_LOCKERROOM_RUBBLE_OPTB_FAIL;the rocks crack against the door and you manage to break through. When you exit you see that they aren't dust and you've just scattered them around making a big mess. Mickey hands you a broom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

ERB_FACEBENDER_POS_OPT;I'm getting better at bending without moving.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FACEBENDER_NEG_OPT;How can I bend without moving my body?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FACEBENDER_DESC;Let's try Facebending. Facebending is the ability to Earth Bend without moving your body. You don't even need a connection to the ground. Facebending isn't flashy like some of those other gimmicks, but it gets the job done.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FACEBENDER_OPT_DESC;Let's try it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FACEBENDER_SUCCESS;I'm a facebender now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_SUCCESSFUL_FACEBENDER;Mickey's training paid off. I'm now able to bend without moving my body.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

ERB_FACEBENDER_FAILURE_OPT;I'm sure we'll still find my gimmick.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

#facebender suspended from ceiling
ERB_SUSPENDED_FROM_CEILING;You awaken bleery eyed and confused. You can't move your body. As you look around you realize that you're in some sort of metal coffin with only a hole for your face. The metal is blocking your connection to the earth. Mickey comes in and says, "Morning sleepy head. If you want to get down you're going to have to facebend. While you figure that out I'm just going to read you Chin the Conqueror's 6000 page manifesto." Mickey reads the ramblings of the mad man who faced Kyoshi and you realize that you can't take it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_SUSPENDED_FROM_CEILING_OPT;You close your eyes and hear Mickey fall to the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_SUSPENDED_FROM_CEILING_PASS_DESC;When you look you realize his chair has collapsed, the Earth was bent. You wiggle your lips and a boulder flies at the chains holding you up. You crash to the ground, the metal coffin flying open. You grab the book from Mickey and run out, so he can't read you anymore. You look down at the manifesto and realize it is handwritten. Where did Mickey get this?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_SUSPENDED_FROM_CEILING_PASS_OPT;You can feel the earth even when not touching it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

#Facebender Fancy Party
ERB_FANCY_PARTY_FACEBEND;You arrive at a fancy party, Earth Kingdom nobles dressed to the nines. As you and Mickey approach the doors a guard takes Mickey's invitation. "A pleasure as always, Mr. Rockmill," says the guard. "And just a reminder to you and your guest, no Earth Bending is allowed inside for the safety of our esteemed patrons such as yourself." As you move through the crowd you say to Mickey, "How am I supposed to get through this party if I can't Earth Bend? I need it to function due to my..." Mickey cuts you off. "Facebending." He's right. It's the only way. Yes, it's Earth Bending, but no one would know and it would certainly make blending in with society easier.;
ERB_FANCY_PARTY_FACEBEND_OPT;You use your face to imperceptibly lift the spoon to your mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FANCY_PARTY_FACEBEND_PASS_DESC;The party goes off without a hitch.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_FANCY_PARTY_FACEBEND_PASS_OPT;You can bend without moving.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

#Facebender Cliff Training
ERB_CLIFF_TRAINING_DESC;You and Mickey arrive at a cliff for training. Before you can even react Mickey wraps a rope around you. Suddenly, you're tied up. "Mickey, what are you doing?" "Bend!" he shouts as he throws you off the cliff. Without contact with the earth the only choice is to use your face..;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_CLIFF_TRAINING_OPTA;You try to bend a platform only a few feet below.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_CLIFF_TRAINING_OPTB;You try to bend a slide to carry you down into the ravine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_CLIFF_TRAINING_OPTA_PASS;With a deep breath and a slight nod of the head a platform erupts from the side of the cliff catching you. You sit up and see that you're only a few feet down. Mickey smiles. "Good job, kid. Now we just gotta fine tune it.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_CLIFF_TRAINING_OPTA_FAIL;You try hard not to move, but it's hopeless. You can't bend without moving. Using your arms you try to seek the connection to the earth and pull a platform out of the cliff. Mickey looks down on you and shakes his head in disappointment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_CLIFF_TRAINING_OPTB_PASS;You close your eyes and breath deeply. You need to trust that the earth will catch you. You land with a soft thud and skid down a gentle slope. Mickey steps forward forms a stair case beneath his feet. "That was great, kid. Not a scratch on ya.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_CLIFF_TRAINING_OPTB_FAIL;You close your eyes and breath deeply. You need to trust that the earth will catch you. You can't feel a connection to the earth. Fear courses through you and your feet thrash about and you feel a bit of earth. It's enough. You jettison down a steep slope and land on the ground below with a thud. Mickey moves a rock platform down the side of the cliff and picks you up. You try again. But you struggle to feel that connection without touching the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

#Facebender Locker Room Ambush
ERB_LOCKER_ROOM_AMBUSH_DESC;Done for the day and already in your soled shoes, you open the locker room door, ready to leave. It moves a few inches, then stops. There's a rock wall blocking the door. There's a hole in the wall just big enough for your face. You look through the hole and see Mickey fighting a man with a large sword. Your heart is racing. He's in danager. You have to help him. Suddenly, the man pins Mickey, the sword his against his neck. Any sudden movements would surely end Mickey's life.;
ERB_LOCKER_ROOM_AMBUSH_OPTA;You try to use facebending to knock the man over.;
ERB_LOCKER_ROOM_AMBUSH_OPTB;You try to use facebending to pull Mickey away from the man.;
ERB_LOCKER_ROOM_AMBUSH_OPTA_PASS;With only a loose connection to the Earth around Mickey you crack your neck and a rock lifts from the ground underneath the man with the sword. He topples over and Mickey stands up, dusting himself off. "Nice work. I knew you could do it." The man with the sword quietly lowers the rocks and frees you from the locker room.;
ERB_LOCKER_ROOM_AMBUSH_OPTA_FAIL;Your connection to the earth around Mickey is tenuous at best. You crack your neck and the earth under the man with the sword starts to move, but it's all for not as the man doesn't lose his footing. Mickey sighs. "I know you're better than that kid.";
ERB_LOCKER_ROOM_AMBUSH_OPTB_PASS;Your connection to the Earth around Mickey is weak. But you center yourself and try to lock on. With a blink of the eye the Earth swells around Mickey pulling him down, out of reach of the man with the sword. You use the man's confusion to your advantage and break down the wall blocking the locker room. You then pull Mickey out of the Earth next to you, ready to fight. "Good job, kid. You used facebending to your advantage.";
ERB_LOCKER_ROOM_AMBUSH_OPTB_FAIL;With only a loose connection to the Earth around Mickey, you close your eyes, trying to pull Mickey away from the man. Nothing happens. Mickey sighs. "Are you even trying to move the Earth, kid?" You nod. "If this had been a real fight facebending would have given you a massive advantage against an enemy that didn't know you were there.";
