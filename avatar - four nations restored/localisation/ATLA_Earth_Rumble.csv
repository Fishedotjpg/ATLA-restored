#pillar event
ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_DESC;Mickey brings you into a canyon. "Look out at those pillars. Those are your opponents." There are four pillars in a row, forming a makeshift bridge to the other side of the canyon. "Now, I want you to surround one of those pillars in dust!";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_OPTA_FAIL;The pillar crumbles, but not into dust. It's merely rubble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_OPTB_PASS;As you reach the other side you can't see Mickey. There's too much dust. So with a wave of your hands you settle it. Mickey walks across rocks that he's bending to make a sturdier bridge, slowly clapping. "Now that, kid, was showmanship.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_OPTB_FAIL;As you reach the other side a small blanket of dust covers the makeshift path. You see the shadow of Mickey running across. You quickly realize that wasn't your dust cloud, but his and you duck out of the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_OPTC_PASS;The furthest pillar is covered in a plume of dust. Mickey pats you on the back. "Ya did good, kid. Now we just gotta add a bit more flare to that talent.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_PILLAR_TRAINING_OPTC_FAIL;The furthest pillar crumbles. Mickey sighs and puts it back up with his bending. "Again." You try again. Over and over the same thing. By the end of the day you go home defeated, not even feeling a comforting layer of earth on your skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ERB_DUST_FIGHTER_POS_OPT;I'm getting better at controlling the particles.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
